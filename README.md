# AAC Noisy Input Correction Engine

A lightweight, interpretable correction system for noisy AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) input. This system uses a **Noisy Channel Model** framework to correct user-generated text errors commonly seen in switch-access, eyegaze, dwell typing, and other AAC modalities.

It leverages a high-performance **PPM language model** to score intended inputs (`P(intended)`) and a configurable **error model** to estimate `P(noisy | intended)` based on simulated input errors.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Use Case

AAC users often make input errors due to physical or interface constraints. This project helps correct such errors in real time or during post-processing, improving intelligibility and user experience without requiring a neural network.

---

## ðŸ”§ Architecture

The system is modular and easy to customize or expand:

aac-corrector/
â”œâ”€â”€ module1_noise_simulator/      # Simulates noisy input from clean data
â”œâ”€â”€ module2_confusion_matrix/     # Builds a character-level error model
â”œâ”€â”€ module3_candidate_generator/  # Suggests candidate corrections for a noisy input
â”œâ”€â”€ module4_corrector/            # Combines PPM and error model to select the best correction
â”œâ”€â”€ demo/                         # CLI or simple UI for testing and visualization
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                         # Sample wordlists and simulated datasets
â””â”€â”€ README.md

Each module is standalone and reusable in other AAC or correction projects.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- **Modular Error Simulation**: Simulate access-method-specific errors (missed hits, double hits, proximity errors).
- **Character-Level Confusion Matrix**: Tuned from realistic simulated noise, supports insertion, deletion, substitution, and transposition.
- **Flexible Candidate Generation**: Efficiently generate and filter plausible corrections using edit distance, keyboard adjacency, and lexicon constraints.
- **Probabilistic Correction Engine**: Ranks candidates using:

score = log P(intended) + log P(noisy | intended)

Powered by your enhanced PPM model.

- **No Neural Dependencies**: Designed for low-resource, interpretable deployment.

## ðŸ›  Setup

Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (e.g. Levenshtein, numpy)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/aac-corrector.git
cd aac-corrector
pip install -r requirements.txt

ðŸš€ Usage

1. Simulate Errors

python module1_noise_simulator/simulate.py --input data/wordlist.txt --output data/noisy_pairs.json

2. Build Confusion Matrix

python module2_confusion_matrix/build.py --input data/noisy_pairs.json --output data/confusion_matrix.json

3. Run Correction

python module4_corrector/correct.py --input "thes is a tst" --output corrected.txt


â¸»

ðŸ§ª Evaluation

Use demo/eval.py to test accuracy of correction across datasets with varying noise profiles. Includes:
	â€¢	Accuracy@1
	â€¢	Accuracy@N
	â€¢	Context-aware reranking (optional)

â¸»

ðŸ“š Future Enhancements
	â€¢	Access-specific confusion models (eyegaze vs touch vs switch)
	â€¢	Word-level confusion matrices
	â€¢	Beam search decoding
	â€¢	Integration with AAC systems or TTS pipelines
